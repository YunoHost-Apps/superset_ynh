If you installed a new instance of Superset on v5.0.0~ynh1 (released on 2025-09-06), it did not ship with a database for user data, sorry for that! Migration is not handled, it is preferable to remove the app and install it again.
If you upgraded to that version from an existing instance, you are not affected by the issue.

This release also includes support for common external databases (MySQL, SQL server, PostgreSQL). The instructions have been updated in the app's page of your webadmin.
